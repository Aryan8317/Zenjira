# 🚨 URGENT: Repository Permission Configuration Required

## THE PROBLEM

**ALL workflows are failing with 403 errors** because the repository doesn't allow workflows to:
- Add labels to PRs
- Create/update comments  
- Approve workflows
- Access repository resources

This affects **EVERY contributor** and makes the repository unusable for external contributions.

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings

1. Navigate to: **https://github.com/Promptzy/Zenjira/settings/actions**
2. Or: Repository → Settings → Actions → General

### Step 2: Configure These Settings EXACTLY

#### ✅ **Actions permissions:**
- ☑️ **Allow all actions and reusable workflows**

#### ✅ **Fork pull request workflows:** (CRITICAL!)
- ☑️ **Run workflows from fork pull requests** 
- ☑️ **Send write tokens to workflows from fork pull requests**
- ☑️ **Send secrets to workflows from fork pull requests**

#### ✅ **Workflow permissions:** (CRITICAL!)
- ☑️ **Read and write permissions** 
- ☑️ **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**

### Step 3: Save Changes

Click **Save** after making all changes above.

## 🎯 WHY THIS IS CRITICAL

Without these settings:
- ❌ No PR labeling works
- ❌ No workflow auto-approval works  
- ❌ No bot commands work
- ❌ No contribution tracking works
- ❌ Contributors get frustrated and leave

## 🧪 IMMEDIATE TEST

After configuring:
1. Ask a contributor to create a test PR
2. Check if workflows run automatically
3. Verify labels get applied
4. Confirm bot comments work

## 🚀 ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION (If you can't change settings)

If you don't have admin access to change repository settings:

### Option A: Create a Personal Access Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token (classic) with `repo` scope
3. Add as repository secret named `PAT_TOKEN`

### Option B: Contact Repository Owner
Ask the repository owner (@Va16hav07, @Pranjal6955) to configure the settings above.

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS

❌ **BROKEN**: All workflows failing with 403 errors  
❌ **IMPACT**: Contributors cannot contribute effectively  
⚠️ **URGENCY**: High - affects all external contributions  
✅ **SOLUTION**: Repository settings configuration (5 minutes)

## 🔍 VERIFICATION AFTER FIX

After configuring settings, you should see:
- ✅ Workflows run automatically on new PRs
- ✅ Labels applied automatically
- ✅ Bot comments posted successfully  
- ✅ No more 403 permission errors

This is a **one-time configuration** that will fix the issue for all future contributions permanently.

**⏰ TIME SENSITIVE: This should be fixed immediately to restore repository functionality.**
