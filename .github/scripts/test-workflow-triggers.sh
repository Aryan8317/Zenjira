echo ""

echo "‚öôÔ∏è Backend workflows will trigger on:"
echo "  - Changes to backend/** files"

echo "‚úÖ Test Scenarios:"
echo "=================="
echo ""

echo "1. Test .github directory changes:"
echo "   - Modify .github/workflows/*.yml files"
echo "   - Should NOT trigger frontend/backend checks"
echo "   - Should only trigger labeling and auto-approval workflows"

echo "2. Test frontend changes:"
echo "   - Modify frontend/** files"

echo "   - Should NOT trigger backend-checks.yml"

echo "3. Test backend changes:"

echo "4. Test mixed changes:"
echo "   - Modify both frontend and backend files"
echo "   - Should trigger both frontend and backend checks"
echo "   - Should trigger code-quality.yml for both"

echo "5. Test documentation changes:"
echo "   - Modify *.md files only"
echo "   - Should only trigger labeling workflows"
echo "   - Should NOT trigger Node.js-based workflows"

echo "‚ùó Common Issues Fixed:"
echo "======================="
echo "  ‚úÖ Removed global npm cache from code-quality.yml"

echo "üîß If you still see npm cache errors:"
echo "====================================="
echo "  1. Check that package-lock.json exists in frontend/ and backend/"
echo "  2. Verify workflows have correct cache-dependency-path"
echo "  3. Make sure Node.js setup is conditional"
echo "  4. Use '/check' command to re-run workflows"

echo "üìö Related Files:"
echo "=================="
echo "  - .github/workflows/code-quality.yml (fixed npm cache issue)"
echo "  - .github/workflows/frontend-checks.yml (has correct cache path)"
echo "  - .github/workflows/backend-checks.yml (has correct cache path)"
echo "  - .github/workflows/cmd-check.yml (new /check command)"
